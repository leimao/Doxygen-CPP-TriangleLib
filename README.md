# Doxygen C++ TriangleLib

This library is the C++ version of the Triangle library corresponding to the [Python Triangle library](https://github.com/leimao/Sphinx-Python-TriangleLib) used for Doxygen documentation tutorial.


We asked Sphinx to use Doxygen to create the documentations, as if the documentations were generated by Sphinx, followed by hosting the documentations on [Read the Docs](`https://readthedocs.org/dashboard/import/manual/`).

## Installation

### Install Dependencies

The `trianglelib` used for the tutorial has no dependency. To install the Doxygen dependencies, please run the following command in the terminal.

```
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get install -y doxygen graphviz
```

To install the Python dependencies, please run the following command in the terminal.


```
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Build TriangleLib

To build the `trianglelib`, please run the following command in the terminal.

```
$ mkdir -p build
$ cd build
$ cmake ..
$ make -j
```
